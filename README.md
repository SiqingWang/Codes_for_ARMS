# Codes for ARMS (Free and Open Source) for wired and wireless resistance measurement system

The codes provided are targeted at Research Users (Electrical Engineering/Sensing/Wireless Communication, etc) and written in/for Python 3.3+ (but may work on others).

This software was initially written by Siqing Wang and Justin Kwok from 2021-2024 as a resistance measurement tool for wireless (SNAP) or wired (Arduino UNO R3) applications.

Within our lab (Diao Group at the University of Illinois http://diao.scs.illinois.edu) we have succesfully used it for wired or wireless measurement of electrical resistance of strain sensors for plant growth monitoring applications.

The software is written to be convenient for researchers with features like automatic data plotting, logging, and saving. Please feel free to contact us at yingdiao@illinois.edu for any other questions on the usage of the codes.
